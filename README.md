# Static-Routing

In React.js, static routing involves defining and managing routes within a single-page application (SPA) using libraries like react-router-dom. Unlike traditional web applications where each page request triggers a server round-trip, SPAs handle navigation and content updates dynamically within the browser, based on predefined routes.
